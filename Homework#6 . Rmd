Article 1:” The Impact of the Economic Crisis on Happiness”  by “Dora Gudrun Gudmundsdottir”.
It Points out to the causation of the increase or decrease in income on the happiness and correlation between unemployment and unhappiness, and this explores which groups are more vulnerable to changes according to demographic factors and health.

It also studies how the economic recession effects on the mental health, mortality and suicide rate which leads to the unhappiness.

This paper indicates how well a society is doing as a good indicator to the wellbeing. and determines how money can buy happiness.

Data: A postal Health Survey conducted by the PHI that was sent out in October 2007 and again in November 2009. 

Results: 
	Women had a higher happiness rate in 2007 compared to men.

Article 2 : “Two Happiness Puzzles” by “Angus Deaton and Arthur A. Stone”
Studies two levels of happiness, (left fork) : That income ,education and health are positively linked with (SWB) (Subjective wellbeing) , and (right fork) : That unemployment is much worse than loss of income.

Using the data from the U.S, Canada , Europe , and developing countries in which researchers regressed some wellbeing measures on both individual income and average income over some local area.

Basic data: The Gallup Healthways wellbeing Index Survey.



Results: 
	There are rich countries that are still ranked as unhappy countries.
	The data used doesn’t support that income generates externalities for others.
	More religious individuals should have higher well-being, But that didn’t apply in the U.S in this data  , As data showed that religious states have lower average ladder values and the more religious states are more sharply poorer.
